# XAI in DoorDash Delivery Duration Prediction Model

#### Leveraged XAI techniques (e.g., SHAP & EBM) to interpret the significance of predictors in forecasting delivery times
#### Applied model selection using 7 different ML regressors (Ridge, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, LGBM, MLP) and 2 different scalers (Standard Scaler, Min/Max Scaler) on 4 different data sets (80-40-20-10 features), using Python
#### Reduced dimensions from 177 to 7 key features, halved RMSE to 1003.11, reduced duration prediction error by 16.1%
